### <ins> Bookmakers' Accuracy Measurement:</ins>

#### <ins>Question:</ins> How accurate is the bookmakers' probabilty prediction of which team will win a football match in comaprison to the actual results?
#### <ins>Answer:</ins> The predicition of the winner by the bookies deviates by 0.67% from the actual results of the English Premier League for the last 5 years.

#### <ins>Analysis:</ins>

üéØ In this part we will assess how accurate are the bookmaker predictions as follows:

- As bookmaker predictions I consider the final odds (The odds offered just before the kickoff of each match) from 3 major bookmakers: Pinnacle, Bet365 and William Hill.
This does not mean that the odds are stable throughout their offering, but they fluctuate due to various reasons, many times significantly.
This means that this analysis does not measure the performance of the bookmakers in general, it only compares the final snapshot of the odds offer in comparison to the actual results.

- The odds are the perceived probability of the three possible outcomes of a match (each team winning the match & the match ends winnless) plus a pecent of profit margin (overround). 

- The measure for the comparison will be the average probability of each winning selection in comparison to the average implied probability offered by the books for each winning selection.

This is the dataset we will work on.

#Confirmation percentage per selection (H,D,A)
select (count(FTR)/(SELECT COUNT(*) FROM premierleague.odds_table_1)) as Avg_Winning_Seln
from premierleague.odds_table_1

```
‚ùï So the percentages of the matches that ended in Home Win, Draw and Away Win respectively: ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/69303154/209353394-aa9cc78f-3ca2-4203-bee2-2995ba4dab12.png)

Now we should find the implied probabilities proposed by the books for all the won selections:
Before we continue we must remove the profit margin from the odds. First we must calculate it and then we should raise each odds price to the power of the calculated margin of each match. The final odds should give us a sum of 1.

```ruby
#Removing the margin from the Winning_odds column
UPDATE premierleague.odds_table_1
SET 
Winning_odds=case 
when FTR="H" THEN Round(Home_Average*(1/Home_Average+1/Draw_Average+1/Away_Average),2)
when FTR="D" THEN Round(Draw_Average*(1/Home_Average+1/Draw_Average+1/Away_Average),2)
ELSE Round(Away_Average*(1/Home_Average+1/Draw_Average+1/Away_Average),2)
END;

# Average winning odds per selection (without margin) 
SELECT Round(1/AVG(Winning_odds),4) as Bookies_Average_Odds
from premierleague.odds_table_1
group by FTR;
```
On average the three bookies are offering the following probabilities for Home Win, Draw and Away Win respectively: ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/69303154/209358716-ee9578f7-378b-4126-bafe-3a6b2f1ef543.png)


‚ñ∂Ô∏èLet's compare the two results: ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/69303154/209353394-aa9cc78f-3ca2-4203-bee2-2995ba4dab12.png) - ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/69303154/209358735-2105f65b-b932-4a0d-b771-9bd23d0c1adf.png)


As expected the first image's sum is excactly 1 which was to be expected as all matches must end with one of the three outcomes.
The second image's sum is 0.9933. 

This means that the bookies on average are predicting the correct outcome with 0.67% inaccuacy.

This means that the predicition of the winner deviates by 0.67% from the actual results probability of the last 5 years. 

üí°This means additionally that if a player would bet to all 3 outcomes <ins>without winning margin</ins> he would have 0.67% of his total stake as net winnings.
This however is covered by the winning margin which is usually 3-4%. This explains the bookies profitability long term.
