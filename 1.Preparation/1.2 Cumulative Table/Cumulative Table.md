**In this section a wide cumulative table will be created**

In order to conduct this part of the analysis the following steps will be followed:
a. Creation of two tables HomeTeams and AwayTeams which will aggregate the stats and points for each team separately.
b. Merging and summarizing those two tables 

**For the calculation of the cards the following Card Points system has been followed: Each Yellow card is worth one Card Point and each Red Card is worth 2 Card Points. A column with the mathes played will be added with the following method: First a separate table will be created counting all the matches played by each team at home and another one for matches played away. Then each one will be Joined to the corresponding home and away cumulative table.
```
#Creation of aggregate table for the most important statistics for the home teams (both for and against) with descriptive aliases in each new column.
#All stats are marked as H to indicate that they are gathered from the matches of the home matches of each team.

#Merging of the two tables into one big table with data for home and matches separated.
create table Wide_Table
SELECT *

```

The final Cumulative table will be created by creating a table which will add the home and away stats of each team, adding an additional column for the goal difference and will rank the teams on the basis of points won over the last 5 years.
